<p>In March 2015, I was hit by a car while on my bike in a crosswalk, and
was ticketed for failure to yield the right of way. I got interested
in bicycle safety and, as a software engineer by trade, I decided to
download, parse, and quantify as much crash data as possible from the
Lincoln Police Department.</p>

<div class="section" id="interpreting">
<h2>Interpreting These Data</h2>

In the data below, bike-car collisions are categorized based on where
they happened. Five locations are tracked:

<ul class="simple">
  <li><b>Crosswalk</b>: Collision happened while a person on a bicycle
    was using a crosswalk; that is, attempting to cross a road or
    intersection either in a painted crosswalk, or crossing an
    intersection from one sidewalk to another. This does not include
    cyclists who are riding on the street and pass through the
    intersection without using a crosswalk.</li>
  <li><b>Sidewalk</b>: Collision happened while a person on a bicycle
    was riding on a sidewalk. For instance, a car entering or leaving
    a private driveway or, in extreme situations, a car that jumps the
    curb.</li>
  <li><b>Road</b>: Collision happened while a person on a bicycle was
    riding on the road, excluding intersections.</li>
  <li><b>Intersection</b>: Collision happened while a person on a
    bicycle was riding through an intersection on the road, not using
    a crosswalk.</li>
  <li><b>Elsewhere</b>: Collision happened elsewhere (alleyways,
    parking lots, etc.). This also includes crashes that happened on
    the road, but where the cyclist was not riding on the road as
    such. (E.g., the cyclist was crossing the street away from a
    crosswalk.)</li>
</ul>

There is some inherent difficulty in categorizing certain types of
crashes; for instance, if a cyclist enters a crosswalk from a sidewalk
but, midway through the intersection leaves the crosswalk, it's
impossible to know if the cyclist was intending to enter the roadway,
avoid an obstacle and continue in the crosswalk, or so on.

<div class="section" id="quantitative-results">
<h2>Quantitative Results</h2>

<p>The current dataset includes {{report_count}} reports, from
{{first_report.strftime("%B %e, %Y")}} to {{last_report.strftime("%B
%e, %Y")}}. {{unparseable_count}} reports could not be parsed, largely
because they were handwritten. Of the reports that could be parsed,
{{bike_reports}} ({{ '%0.1f' % (100.0 * bike_reports / report_count)
}}%) involved a person on a bicycle.</p>

<p>This number is almost certainly an underestimate, for several
reasons:</p>

<ul class="simple">
  <li>Not every accident is reported. Non-injury accidents in
    particular may not be; anecdotally, I was initially advised not to
    file an accident report when I was hit, since my injuries were
    very minor.</li>
  <li>Some accident reports are not available online.</li>
  <li>Some accident reports, particularly older ones, are handwritten
    and thus were not automatically parseable.</li>
  <li>Accident reports are not written for bicycle-bicycle or
    bicycle-pedestrian crashes.</li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="location">
<h3>Location</h3>

<p>The majority of crashes involving a bicycle
({{statuses.crosswalk}}/{{bike_reports}}) happened in a crosswalk:</p>

<img src="{{imagedir}}/proportions.png"/>

<p>Large numbers of crashes also involve people riding in the street,
and people riding in sidewalks. (Most sidewalk accidents involve cars
turning into private drives, but a few featured cars jumping the
curb.) A smattering involves people riding elsewhere, which includes
parking lots, or crossing streets in the middle of blocks (i.e., away
from crosswalks). For the sake of this analysis, I have counted bike
lanes as the road, although I noted only one case of
{{"B2-035865"|report_link("an accident involving a bike lane")}}.</p>

<p>Clearly, crosswalks are far and away the most dangerous place for
cyclists. No matter what other riding patterns are, cyclists almost
certainly spend orders of magnitude more time out of crosswalks, so
more than half the accidents happening in crosswalks is pretty clearly
damning.</p>

<p>Unfortunately clear data on the number of miles ridden on streets
as compared to sidewalks are not available, so it's not possible to
extrapolate from the data shown above to conclude whether it's more
dangerous to ride in the street or on the sidewalk.</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, no crashes were reported on off-street bike
paths. (Recall that these data only include car-bike accidents;
bike-bike and bike-pedestrian accidents certainly do occur on the
off-street bike paths.)</p>

<p>The location of crashes varies slightly by the age of the
cyclist:</p>

<img src="{{imagedir}}/location_by_age.png"/>

<p>Again, though, without data on the number of miles ridden in
various scenarios, it's hard to make much sense of these data --
especially with such variable-sized (and often small) data sets. The
51-to-60 set seems to be doing something interesting, though; perhaps
these cyclists ride on the street more often than cyclists of other
ages.</p>
</div>

<div class="section" id="timing">
<h3>Timing</h3>

<p>Predictably, most accidents happen during the summer months:</p>

<img src="{{imagedir}}/monthly.png"/>

<p>Although this graph appears to show a trend of increasing
accidents, this interpretation should be adopted cautiously, as there
are a number of confounding variables. (Hopefully, it represents an
increase in the number of miles ridden; it almost certainly also
represents a decrease in handwritten accident reports.)</p>

<p>By time of day, commutes are the most dangerous:</p>

<img src="{{imagedir}}/crash_times.png"/>

<p>It's interesting that the evening commute -- not the presumably
darker morning commute -- is more dangerous.</p>
</div>

<div class="section" id="injury-rates">
<h3>Injury rates</h3>

<p>Interestingly, different locations have different injury rates:</p>

<img src="{{imagedir}}/injury_rates.png"/>

<p>Non-injury crashes are the most likely crashes to not be reported,
so these rates are hopefully overestimates.</p>

<p>Sidewalks have the highest injury rate, but also the most
non-disabling injuries. Crashes occurring on the road are the least
likely to lead to injuries, but when they do, the injuries are more
likely to be disabling. Intersections also show more disabling
injuries. Overall, a collision while riding in the street (whether in
an intersection or not) is about 2% less likely to result in injury,
but about 12% more likely to result in disabling injury.</p>

<p>Note that these data are based entirely on accident reports, and so
do not take into account cyclists who are hit and later killed; the
"Killed" category only represents cyclists who were dead at the
scene.</p>

<p>Overall, while disabling injuries are scary, they represent a
fairly small percentage of crashes:</p>

<img src="{{imagedir}}/injury_severities.png"/>

<p>That said, it's still worrisome that a cyclist is about as likely
to escape a crash unscathed as to suffer disabling injury.</p>

<p>Injury severity varies only slightly with the age of the
cyclist:</p>

<img src="{{imagedir}}/severity_by_age.png"/>

<p>This graph uses the LPD injury rating scale, where {{1|literal}} is
killed and {{5|literal}} is uninjured, so lower numbers are more
severe injuries. Teenagers and early twenty-somethings seem to suffer
the most severe injuries, but even then the average hovers near
"Visible but not disabling." (The other points on the graph that dip
below that line have too few data points to be reliable.)
Unfortunately the age of uninjured cyclists is rarely included in the
accident report, and never in a fashion that's trivial to parse
automatically, so this graph does not take into account uninjured
cyclists.</p>

<p>Predictably, injuries are most common to the extremities,
particularly the lower legs:</p>

<img src="{{imagedir}}/injury_regions.png"/>

<h2>Map of Crashes</h2>

<p>All locations should be considered approximations, and there are
almost certainly mistakes in places.</p>

<p>Some takeaways:</p>

<ul class="simple">
  <li>Some intersections may seem more dangerous solely because they
    are more heavily trafficked, not because they are actually more
    dangerous.</li>
  <li>That said, a few corridors seem particularly dangerous, with
    Capital Parkway/Normal Blvd. leading the pack. The intersections
    with 27th, 33rd, and South are all among the most dangerous in the
    city.</li>
  <li>The 27th street and Vine street corridors put in strong bids for
    second-most dangerous, and unsurprisingly 27th and Vine is a
    hotbed of crosswalk crashes.</li>
  <li>In general, crashes increase towards downtown and diminish as
    you get further out. There are two notable exceptions: The entire
    length of 84th street (with nearly twice as many crosswalk crashes
    as 70th and 56th streets); and Pine Lake near 27th. These two
    areas have something in common: Bike paths adjacent to streets,
    where cyclists must still cross many side streets. Superior
    street, which also has a street-adjacent bike path, has no nearby
    analogue to compare it to, but it has as many crosswalk crashes as
    Havelock, Fremont, and Holdrege combined.</li>
  <li>A significant number of crosswalk and sidewalk crashes occur in
    the downtown exclusion area. Stop riding on the sidewalks downtown
    already! It's not even safer!</li>
  <li>Road crashes, predictably, are focused downtown. But at least
    riding on the streets is legal.</li>
</ul>

<p>This map may actually contain actionable information; many of the
most dangerous intersections are at or near bike path underpasses or
overpasses, so you can avoid crossing 27th at Vine, for instance, on
the Mopac Trail.</p>
</div>

<div class="section" id="qualitative-results">
<h2>Qualitative Results</h2>

<p>A number of interesting trends revealed themselves in reading
through the reports. Most disturbingly, at least some members of LPD
have a significant misunderstanding of the law, claiming in the
{{"B3-063805"|report_link("accident")}}
{{"B4-050934"|report_link("report")}} that
{{"B4-085278"|report_link("cyclists are required")}} to walk their
bike across intersections, and {{"B4-107448"|report_link("in some
cases")}} specifically {{"B5-074595"|report_link("noting")}} that they
"{{"B3-104457"|report_link("lectured")}}" the cyclist.</p>

<p>In other (fewer) {{"B3-096911"|report_link("cases")}}, the officer
has a {{"B4-063856"|report_link("correct understanding")}} of the law,
and in some cases {{"B3-042103"|report_link("the driver of the car was
ticketed")}} for {{"B2-062920"|report_link("failure to yield")}} to a
cyclist in a crosswalk.</p>

<p>The law for crossing private drives is less clear, but
{{"B2-106960"|report_link("at least one cop")}} thinks that bikes on
sidewalks must yield to cars in driveways.</p>

<p>Perhaps ironically, in {{"B4-055506"|report_link("one case")}} a
cyclist who had dismounted to walk his bike across the intersection
was hit while on foot.</p>

<p>In some cases, the accident report
{{"B3-046597"|report_link("mentions")}} that the cyclist
{{"B4-032910"|report_link("was not wearing a helmet")}}, despite the
fact that this has absolutely no legal bearing, nor does it have any
bearing on whether or not a cyclist is hit. It's hard to see this as
anything other than editorial victim-blaming.</p>

<p>A {{"B3-049103"|report_link("number")}} of accident reports reverse
the agents, claiming that {{"B4-065578"|report_link("a bike hit a
car")}} in cases where the car clearly hit the bike. In some cases,
it's described {{"B4-034454"|report_link("both ways")}}. It's not
clear why this inversion of causality occurs.</p>

<p>In some cases, bicyclists "{{"B2-019522"|report_link("suddenly
appear")}}". Stop {{"B3-063032"|report_link("apparating")}} in public
or the muggles will catch on! (Strangely, the accident reports where
cyclists {{"B5-081151"|report_link("appear")}} show the bike moving
through space normally, not teleporting.)</p>

<p>The only place {{"B2-057557"|report_link("two")}} "elsewhere"
{{"B3-023161"|report_link("crashes")}} occurred is on 27th street,
just south of Highway 2, where there's a cutout of the median to let
train tracks cross 27th street. People are crossing a busy arterial
street with no crosswalk along train tracks -- with a pedestrian
bridge overhead. Please don't be dumb.</p>

<p>{{"B2-072693"|report_link("Please")}},
{{"B4-049988"|report_link("get information")}} from a
{{"B2-072693"|report_link("driver")}} who
{{"B4-090913"|report_link("hits
you")}}. {{"B2-065976"|report_link("Call the police.")}}
{{"B3-047233"|report_link("File a report.")}}</p>

<div class="section" id="methodology">
<h2>Methodology</h2>

<p>Accident reports are downloaded automatically from the
<a href="https://lincoln.ne.gov/city/police/stats/acc.htm"
class="reference external">Lincoln Police Department's
website</a>. The reports are parsed automatically and selected data
are extracted. The data are available at <a href="{{all_reports}}"
class="reference external">{{all_reports}}</a>.

<p>These reports are then curated by hand to determine where the crash
happened, as described above. This depends on the accuracy of the
accident report; anecdotally, several cyclists have reported to me
that their accident reports were not completely accurate. I found one
accident report where the {{"B3-074762"|report_link("drawing does not
look like the actual intersection")}} where the collision happened, so
there are definitely at least some inaccuracies. These inaccuracies
are not expected to be significant, but there's no obvious way to test
this with the given data set.</p>

<p>Much of the methodology is described in more detail in the
<a href="https://github.com/stpierre/crashes/blob/master/README.rst"
class="reference external">README</a>.  All of the code used to
generate this report is free and open source under the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.en.html"
class="reference external">GPLv2</a>.</p>

<p>I have made no effort at all to determine fault, as that process
would be fraught beyond any semblance of reason.</p>

<p>The Lincoln Police Department deserves special thanks for their
open records. In the other two largest cities in Nebraska, the Omaha
and Grand Island Police Departments both charge for accident reports
($5 and $6, respectively), and the Omaha Police Department does not
allow listing accident reports. Lincoln's open records made this
project possible.</p>
</div>

<div class="section" id="further-study">
<h2>Further Study</h2>

<p>There are lots of hit-and-runs, mostly by cars but in some cases by
cyclists, too. (The cyclists who run from a crash seem to generally be
kids.) It'd be nice to gather data on that.</p>

<p>The data may be too few to be statistically significant, but
quantifying the number of crosswalk crashes in areas with
street-adjacent bike paths (as opposed to other areas) could be an
eye-opener.</p>

<p>Charting the time of day of crashes throughout the calendar year
might demonstrate how darkness affects (or doesn't affect)
crashes.</p>
