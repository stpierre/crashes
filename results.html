        <p>In March 2015, I was hit by a car while on my bike in a
          bike path crosswalk, and was ticketed for failure to yield
          the right of way. I got interested in bicycle safety and, as
          a software engineer by trade, I decided to download, parse,
          and quantify as much collision data as possible from the
          Lincoln Police Department.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <h2>Interpreting These Data</h2>

          In the data below, bike-car collisions are categorized based
          on where they happened. The following locations are tracked:

          <ul class="simple">
{% for name, desc in status_descriptions.items() %}
            <li><b>{{ name }}</b>: {{ desc }}</li>
{% endfor %}
          </ul>

          <p>There is some inherent difficulty in categorizing certain
            types of collisions; for instance, if a cyclist enters a
            crosswalk from a sidewalk but, midway through the
            intersection leaves the crosswalk, it's impossible to know
            if the cyclist was intending to enter the roadway, avoid
            an obstacle and continue in the crosswalk, or so on.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <h2>Quantitative Results</h2>

          <p>The current dataset includes {{
            "{0:,}".format(report_count) }} reports, from {{
            first_report }} to {{ last_report }}. Since 2012, when LPD
            started widespread use of computer-written accident
            reports, the dataset includes {{
            "{0:,}".format(post_2011_reports) }} reports, {{
            "{0:,}".format(bike_reports) }} ({{ '%0.1f' % bike_pct
            }}%) of which involved a person on a bicycle.</p>

          <p>This number is almost certainly an underestimate, for
            several reasons:</p>

          <ul class="simple">
            <li>Not every accident is reported. Non-injury accidents
              in particular may not be; anecdotally, I was initially
              advised not to file an accident report when I was hit,
              since my injuries were very minor.</li>
            <li>Accident reports are not written for bicycle-bicycle
              or bicycle-pedestrian collisions.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Nearly all of the post-2011 reports are from LPD, but
            {{ ndor_count }} reports came from the Nebraska Department
            of Roads <i>[sic]</i>
            via <a href="http://www.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html?webmap=76d544b5646645dcaa8e9ba5c5543d0a">Lacey
            Matney's 2014 study</a>. All of the data from 2008-2011
            is from NDOR.</p>

          <p>Because the first four years of data in this dataset is
            from NDOR, and includes less data, some of the reports
            below only include data from 2012 onward, while others
            include data from 2008. I've noted this where it's
            relevant.</p>

          <p>{{ unparseable_count }} reports could not be parsed
            automatically, largely because they were handwritten. The
            years 2012-2014 have been cross-checked against the NDOR
            data (which includes handwritten reports), and the handful
            of handwritten reports from 2015 have been manually
            parsed.</p>

        <div class="{{ section_class.next() }}">
          <h3>Collision locations</h3>

          <div class="ct-chart ct-major-seventh left"
               id="location-pie-chart"></div>

          <div class="right">
            <p>The majority of collisions involving a bicycle
              ({{statuses.crosswalk}}/{{bike_reports}}) happened in a
              crosswalk.</p>

            <p>Large numbers of collisions also involve people riding
              in the street, and people riding in sidewalks. (Most
              sidewalk accidents involve cars turning into private
              drives, but a few featured cars jumping the curb.) A
              smattering involves people riding elsewhere, which
              includes parking lots, or crossing streets in the middle
              of blocks (i.e., away from crosswalks). Collisions in
              bike lanes are very rare indeed, but that likely
              reflects the rarity of bike lanes more than
              anything.</p>

            <p>Clearly, crosswalks are far and away the most dangerous
              place for cyclists. No matter what other riding patterns
              are, cyclists almost certainly spend orders of magnitude
              more time out of crosswalks, so more than half the
              accidents happening in crosswalks is pretty clearly
              damning.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately clear data on the number of miles ridden
              on streets as compared to sidewalks are not available,
              so it's not possible to extrapolate from the data shown
              above to conclude whether it's more dangerous to ride in
              the street or on the sidewalk. It is worth noting,
              though, that {{ '%0.1f' % (100.0 * total_sidewalk /
              bike_reports) }}% ({{total_sidewalk}}) of the collisions
              indicate a pattern of riding on sidewalks, while merely
              {{ '%0.1f' % (100.0 * total_road / bike_reports) }}%
              ({{total_road}}) indicate a pattern of riding in the
              street.</p>

            <p>Unsurprisingly, no collisions were reported on
              off-street bike paths. (Recall that these data only
              include car-bike accidents; bike-bike and
              bike-pedestrian accidents certainly do occur on the
              off-street bike paths.)</p>

            <p>Again, though, without data on the number of miles
              ridden in various scenarios, it's hard to make much
              sense of these data -- especially with such
              variable-sized (and often small) data sets. The 51-to-60
              set seems to be doing something interesting, though,
              with relatively more collisions in intersections and
              fewer in crosswalks than most other groups. Perhaps
              these cyclists ride on the street more often than
              cyclists of other ages.</p>

            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="below">
            <p>For this chart I've invented a couple of metrics. One
              is Monthly Rock Island Riders, or MRIR. The city has had
              a bike traffic counter installed on the Rock Island
              Trail since July 2014, and it provides our best
              estimates of how many people are out riding at any given
              time. So it's a slightly arbitrary number, we expect
              that the number of riders on the Rock Island Trail
              roughly mirrors the total number of riders in Lincoln
              during each month.</p>

            <p>Combining the MRIR with the average number of
              collisions per month we can see a reasonable estimate of
              the collision rate during any given month, measured in
              Collisions Per Monthly Rock Island Rider
              (CPMRIR). Although the line looks fairly flat, this is a
              logarithmic scale so it's anything but -- you're {{
              "%0.1f" % cpmrir_multiplier }} times more likely to be
              hit in {{ cpmrir_max_month }} as in {{ cpmrir_min_month
              }}.</p>

            <p>It's not immediately obvious why this tremendous
              difference -- or why there's such a peak in {{
              cpmrir_max_month }}. One possibility might be more
              darkness during the commute due to the end of Daylight
              Savings Time.</p>

            <p>Interestingly, the increase in ridership during the
              spring months doesn't track CPMRIR, either. That is, it
              doesn't appear that when more cyclists appear on the
              streets they're more likely to be hit; instead there
              seems to be a novelty effect, where March is quite safe
              (relatively speaking) and then collisions go up in April
              once drivers are more accustomed to seeing cyclists on
              the streets.</p>

            <p>Ultimately, for all the fluctuations of the CPMRIR,
              collisions per month correlates quite closely with MRIR
              (r={{ "%0.2f" % mrir_correlation }}), suggesting that
              our transportation system is just plain designed to
              bring cyclists into inevitable conflict with drivers, no
              matter how many of us are on the roads or what time of
              year it is.</p>

          <div class="right">
            <p>Predictably, most accidents by sheer numbers happen
              during the summer months, simply because so many people
              are riding. January has the fewest collisions, making it
              one of the safer months.</p>

          <div class="left">
            <p>The decrease from 2012 to 2013 is real, and very good
              news -- it's a <i>huge</i> drop. Since then things have
              been mostly flat, with the exception of a small decrease
              in 2015. Unfortunately it looks like 2012 was just an
              exceedingly dangerous year, and we're on a very slow
              upward trend in general.</p>

            <p>We only have bike traffic count data from 2014 onward,
              so it's too soon to tell if that upward trend is due to
              increased ridership, or to other factors, or (hopefully)
              if ridership increases outpace collision increases.</p>

            <p>Mean collisions per year is {{ "%0.2f" % yearly_mean }}

          <div class="below">
            <p>Similar to
              the <a href="#toc-monthly-collision-rate">Monthly
              Collision Rate</a> graph above, I've invented a few
              metrics. First is Hourly Rock Island Riders, which is an
              average count of the number of cyclists on the Rock
              Island Trail during any given one-hour period.</p>

            <p>The other new metric is Annual Collisions Per Hour,
              or ACPH. That's the average number of collisions in a
              given one-hour time slot that have happened per year
              since {{ first_report }}.</p>

            <p>From these two metrics, we can see that the most
              dangerous times in terms of Annual Collisions Per Hourly
              Rock Island Rider (ACPHRIR) are the dark hours, followed
              distantly by the morning commute. In particular, the
              hours between midnight and 4 am are incredibly
              dangerous, possibly because the extremely low ridership
              numbers then make even the small numbers of collisions
              inflate the ACPHRIR.</p>

            <p>Although the ACPHRIR rate is lower, most collisions (by
              aggregate count) happen during commutes. It's
              interesting that more people are hit during the evening
              commute -- not the presumably darker morning commute.
              There are fare more collisions during the evening
              commute, but the morning commute is actually more
              dangerous because so many more people are out riding in
              the evening -- nearly twice as many as in the
              morning.</p>

            <p>It's also interesting that we see a steady stream of
              cyclists all day long, but collisions drop off sharply
              outside of commutes. It seems likely that this is due to
              the number of drivers out (and possibly their perceived
              urgency). Initial results (below) indicate that darkness
              has a limited effect on the number of collisions.</p>

            <p>Despite the spikiness of the ACPH, it correlates quite
              well with HRIR (r={{ '%0.2f' % hrir_correlation }}), so
              the number of cyclists out has a significant effect on
              the number of collisions. This is a stronger correlation
              than we see on
              the <a href="#toc-monthly-collision-rate">Monthly
              Collision Rate</a> graph, so time of day has even less
              to do with the rate of collisions than time of year.</p>

            <p>Note that this graph uses a logarithmic (base 2) Y
              axis.</p>

               id="daylight-rate-chart"></div>

          <div class="right">
            <p>Here we see that the collision rate is *much* higher
              at night that during other times -- and that it's much
              <i>lower</i> during times of dim light. This was pretty
              unexpected, given how closely collision rates track
              ridership in other cases; I didn't expect nighttime to
              be that much more dangerous. It's probably a <i>bit</i>
              misleading, due to the presence of the incredibly low
              dusk and dawn bars; ultimately riding at night is only
              {{ "%0.1f" % (night_collision_rate /
              day_collision_rate) }} times more dangerous than riding
              during the day.</p>

            <p>Dusk and dawn are also pretty interesting. It turns out
              that dusk is safe because there are huge numbers of
              cyclists out -- that evening commute is incredibly
              busy. So even though it has a much higher number of
              collisions than dawn, it's the safest phase of the
              day.</p>

            <p>Dusk and dawn may also be thrown off a bit by the
              limited amounts of data available; they're each only
              about 30 minutes long, while the other two phases of the
              day make up the remainder, so we have much more data
              about day and night.</p>

          <h3>Injuries by collision location</h3>

          <div class="left">
            <p>Interestingly, different locations have different
              injury rates.</p>

            <p>Sidewalks have the highest injury rate, but also the
              most non-disabling injuries. Collisions occurring on
              the road are the least likely to lead to injuries, but
              when they do, the injuries are more likely to be
              disabling. Intersections also show more disabling
              injuries. Overall, a collision while riding in the
              street (whether in an intersection or not) is about 2%
              less likely to result in injury, but about 12% more
              likely to result in disabling injury.</p>

            <p>Note that these data are based entirely on accident
              reports, and so do not take into account cyclists who
              are hit and later killed; the "Killed" category only
              represents cyclists who were dead at the scene.</p>

            <p>Non-injury collisions are the most likely collisions to
              not be reported, so all of the injury rates are
              hopefully overestimates.</p>

              by LPD until the following day, and the officer

          </div>

          <p>Luckily, there's not <i>too much</i> red on this
            map. While we're unlikely to avoid any particular
            intersection based simply on the number of collisions
            there, we can be more careful at the more dangerous
            intersections. Some of the most dangerous intersections
            are at or near bike path underpasses or overpasses, so you
            can avoid crossing 27th at Vine, for instance, on the
            Mopac Trail.</p>

          <p>Some intersections may seem more dangerous solely because
            they are more heavily trafficked, not because they are
            actually more dangerous. That said, a few corridors seem
            particularly dangerous, with 27th street from Vine to
            Holdrege leading the pack. Capital Parkway/Normal Blvd. is
            a close second; the intersections with 27th, 33rd, and
            South are all among the most dangerous in the city.</p>

          <p>As an aside, can you imagine what an on-street bike lane
            would do to help out north 27th street and South street
            between 13th and 27th? Both are struggling but viable
            commercial districts that are already lined with local
            businesses, and they have terrific numbers of car-bike

          <p>This gives us some granular detail to see where
            collisions are happening around town. For instance, we
            knew Capitol Parkway and 27th had lots collisions, but
            here we can see that they were all in crosswalks.</p>

          <p>In general, collisions increase towards downtown and
            diminish as you get further out. There are two notable
            exceptions: The entire length of 84th street (with nearly
            twice as many crosswalk collisions as 70th and 56th
            streets); and Pine Lake near 27th. These two areas have
            something in common: Bike paths adjacent to streets, where
            cyclists must still cross many side streets. Superior
            street, which also has a street-adjacent bike path, has no
            nearby analogue to compare it to, but it has as many
            crosswalk collisions as Havelock, Fremont, and Holdrege
            combined.</p>

          <p>A significant number of crosswalk and sidewalk collisions
            occur in the downtown exclusion area. Stop riding on the
            sidewalks downtown already! It's not even safer! (It also
            could {{"B6-045945"|report_link("get you a ticket")}}.)
            Road collisions, predictably, are focused downtown. But at
            least riding on the streets is legal.</p>

          <h2>Qualitative Results</h2>

          <p>A number of interesting trends revealed themselves in
            reading through the reports. Most disturbingly, at least
            some members of LPD have a significant misunderstanding of
            the law, claiming in the
            {{"B3-063805"|report_link("accident")}}
            {{"B4-050934"|report_link("report")}} that
            {{"B4-085278"|report_link("cyclists are required")}} to
            walk their bike across intersections, and
            {{"B4-107448"|report_link("in some cases")}} specifically
            {{"B5-074595"|report_link("noting")}} that they
            "{{"B3-104457"|report_link("lectured")}}" the cyclist.</p>

          <p>Even after LB716 took effect, cops were still
            {{"B6-073532"|report_link("lecturing cyclists")}} about
            {{"B6-086968"|report_link("walking")}} across
            {{"B6-093266"|report_link("sidewalks")}}.</p>

          <p>In other (fewer) {{"B3-096911"|report_link("cases")}},
            the officer had a {{"B4-063856"|report_link("correct
            understanding")}} of the law, and
            "{{"B5-112375"|report_link("educate")}}" the cyclist; and
            in some cases {{"B3-042103"|report_link("the driver of the
            car was ticketed")}} for
            {{"B2-062920"|report_link("failure to yield")}} to a
            cyclist in a crosswalk.</p>

          <p>The law for crossing private drives is less clear, but
            {{"B2-106960"|report_link("at least one cop")}} thinks
            that bikes on sidewalks must yield to cars in driveways,
            while {{"B5-099464"|report_link("another one
            disagrees")}}. One cop {{"B6-050106"|report_link("lectured
            a cyclist")}} who collided with a car in a private drive,
            even though the accident report states that the view was
            blocked. I guess you should leave the Oakleys at home and
            wear your X-ray glasses.</p>

          <p>Perhaps ironically, in {{"B4-055506"|report_link("one
            case")}} a cyclist who had dismounted to walk his bike
            across the intersection was hit while on foot.</p>

          <p>If you get right-hooked by a driver who just can't wait
            three seconds for a parking space, you might just
            {{"B2-092954"|report_link("wind up with a ticket
            yourself")}} for "violating general traffic laws." Which
            laws? Well, general ones, of course.</p>

          <p>In some cases, the accident report
            {{"B3-046597"|report_link("mentions")}} that the cyclist
            {{"B4-032910"|report_link("was not wearing a helmet")}},
            despite the fact that this has absolutely no legal
            bearing, nor does it have any bearing on whether or not a
            cyclist is hit. It's hard to see this as anything other
            than editorial victim-blaming. In another case the fact
            that cyclists *were* {{"B5-102671"|report_link("wearing
            helmets and reflective clothing")}} is mentioned; although
            the reflective clothing has a clear bearing on their
            visibility, helmet use again seems to be mentioned simply
            as part of a false correlation with "proper" cycling.</p>

          <p>A {{"B3-049103"|report_link("number")}} of accident
            reports reverse the agents, claiming that
            {{"B4-065578"|report_link("a bike hit a car")}} in cases
            where the car clearly hit the bike. In some cases, it's
            described {{"B4-034454"|report_link("both ways")}}. It's
            not clear why this inversion of causality occurs.</p>

          <p>Some people, upon hitting a ten-year-old child, can think
            of nothing better to do than

          <h2>Methodology</h2>

          <p>Accident reports are downloaded automatically from the
            <a href="https://lincoln.ne.gov/city/police/stats/acc.htm"
               class="reference external">Lincoln Police Department's
               website</a>. The reports are parsed automatically and
               selected data are extracted. The data are available as
               CSV files at <a href="{{ db_dump }}" class="reference
               external">{{ db_dump }}</a>.

          <p>These reports are then curated by hand to determine where
            the collision happened, as described above. This depends
            on the accuracy of the accident report; anecdotally,
            several cyclists have reported to me that their accident
            reports were not completely accurate. I found one accident
            report where the {{"B3-074762"|report_link("drawing does
            not look like the actual intersection")}} where the
            collision happened, so there are definitely at least some
            inaccuracies. These inaccuracies are not expected to be
            significant, but there's no obvious way to test this with
            the given data set.</p>

          <p>Much of the methodology is described in more detail in the
            <a href="https://github.com/stpierre/crashes/blob/master/README.rst"
               class="reference external">README</a>.  All of the code
               used to generate this report is free and open source
               under the
            <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.en.html"
               class="reference external">GPLv2</a>.</p>

          <p>I have made no effort at all to determine fault, as that
            process would be fraught beyond any semblance of
            reason.</p>

          <p>The Lincoln Police Department deserves special thanks for
            their open records. In the other two largest cities in
            Nebraska, the Omaha and Grand Island Police Departments
            both charge for accident reports ($5 and $6,
            respectively), and the Omaha Police Department does not
            allow listing accident reports. Lincoln's open records
            made this project possible.</p>

          <h2>Further Study</h2>

          <p>Classifying each collision according to the U.S. DOT
            classification system would let us compare data with other
            cities that have published their data, and see how Lincoln
            stacks up.</p>

          <p>It could be interesting to look at how tickets are
            assigned during collisions and see how likely drivers
            and/or cyclists are likely to be ticketed.</p>

          <p>Current traffic data is based only on the Rock Island
            Trail, but the city has other traffic counters and they've
            generously shared the data with me. I need to find a way
            to normalize it all to get a general traffic rate for the
            city based on more than just the Rock Island Trail.</p>
