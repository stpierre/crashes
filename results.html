        <p>In March 2015, I was hit by a car while on my bike in a
          bike path crosswalk, and was ticketed for failure to yield
          the right of way. I got interested in bicycle safety and, as
          a software engineer by trade, I decided to download, parse,
          and quantify as much collision data as possible from the
          Lincoln Police Department.</p>

        <div class="section">
          <h2>Interpreting These Data</h2>

          In the data below, bike-car collisions are categorized based
          on where they happened. Five locations are tracked:

          <ul class="simple">
            <li><b>Crosswalk</b>: Collision happened while a person on
              a bicycle was using a crosswalk; that is, attempting to
              cross a road or intersection either in a painted
              crosswalk, or crossing an intersection from one sidewalk
              to another. This does not include cyclists who are
              riding on the street and pass through the intersection
              without using a crosswalk.</li>
            <li><b>Sidewalk</b>: Collision happened while a person on
              a bicycle was riding on a sidewalk. For instance, a car
              entering or leaving a private driveway or, in extreme
              situations, a car that jumps the curb.</li>
            <li><b>Road</b>: Collision happened while a person on a
              bicycle was riding on the road, excluding
              intersections.</li>
            <li><b>Intersection</b>: Collision happened while a person
              on a bicycle was riding through an intersection on the
              road, not using a crosswalk.</li>
            <li><b>Elsewhere</b>: Collision happened elsewhere
              (alleyways, parking lots, etc.). This also includes
              collisions that happened on the road, but where the
              cyclist was not riding on the road as such. (E.g., the
              cyclist was crossing the street away from a
              crosswalk.)</li>
          </ul>

          <p>There is some inherent difficulty in categorizing certain
            types of collisions; for instance, if a cyclist enters a
            crosswalk from a sidewalk but, midway through the
            intersection leaves the crosswalk, it's impossible to know
            if the cyclist was intending to enter the roadway, avoid
            an obstacle and continue in the crosswalk, or so on.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <h2>Quantitative Results</h2>

          <p>The current dataset includes {{report_count}} reports,
            from {{first_report.strftime("%B %e, %Y")}} to
            {{last_report.strftime("%B %e,
            %Y")}}. {{unparseable_count}} reports could not be parsed,
            largely because they were handwritten. Of the reports that
            could be parsed, {{bike_reports}} ({{ '%0.1f' % (100.0 *
            bike_reports / report_count) }}%) involved a person on a
            bicycle.</p>

          <p>This number is almost certainly an underestimate, for
            several reasons:</p>

          <ul class="simple">
            <li>Not every accident is reported. Non-injury accidents
              in particular may not be; anecdotally, I was initially
              advised not to file an accident report when I was hit,
              since my injuries were very minor.</li>
            <li>Some accident reports are not available online.</li>
            <li>Some accident reports, particularly older ones, are
              handwritten and thus were not automatically
              parseable.</li>
            <li>Accident reports are not written for bicycle-bicycle
              or bicycle-pedestrian collisions.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
          <h3>Location</h3>

          <ul class="tabs">
            <li class="tab-link current" tab-group="location"
                data-tab="tab-location-pie">Collision locations</li>
            <li class="tab-link" tab-group="location"
                data-tab="tab-location-by-age">Locations by age</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="tab-content current" tab-group="location" id="tab-location-pie">
            <img src="{{imagedir}}/proportions.png"/>

            <p>The majority of collisions involving a bicycle
              ({{statuses.crosswalk}}/{{bike_reports}}) happened in a
              crosswalk.</p>

            <p>Large numbers of collisions also involve people riding
              in the street, and people riding in sidewalks. (Most
              sidewalk accidents involve cars turning into private
              drives, but a few featured cars jumping the curb.) A
              smattering involves people riding elsewhere, which
              includes parking lots, or crossing streets in the middle
              of blocks (i.e., away from crosswalks). For the sake of
              this analysis, I have counted bike lanes as the road,
              although I noted only one case of
              {{"B2-035865"|report_link("an accident involving a bike
              lane")}}.</p>

            <p>Clearly, crosswalks are far and away the most dangerous
              place for cyclists. No matter what other riding patterns
              are, cyclists almost certainly spend orders of magnitude
              more time out of crosswalks, so more than half the
              accidents happening in crosswalks is pretty clearly
              damning.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately clear data on the number of miles ridden
              on streets as compared to sidewalks are not available,
              so it's not possible to extrapolate from the data shown
              above to conclude whether it's more dangerous to ride in
              the street or on the sidewalk. It is worth noting,
              though, that {{ '%0.1f' % (100.0 * total_sidewalk /
              bike_reports) }}% ({{total_sidewalk}}) of the collisions
              indicate a pattern of riding on sidewalks, while merely
              {{ '%0.1f' % (100.0 * total_road / bike_reports) }}%
              ({{total_road}}) indicate a pattern of riding in the
              street.</p>

            <p>Unsurprisingly, no collisions were reported on
              off-street bike paths. (Recall that these data only
              include car-bike accidents; bike-bike and
              bike-pedestrian accidents certainly do occur on the
              off-street bike paths.)</p>
          </div>
          <div class="tab-content" tab-group="location" id="tab-location-by-age">
            <img src="{{imagedir}}/location_by_age.png"/>

            <p>The location of collisions varies slightly by the age
              of the cyclist.</p>

            <p>Again, though, without data on the number of miles
              ridden in various scenarios, it's hard to make much
              sense of these data -- especially with such
              variable-sized (and often small) data sets. The 51-to-60
              set seems to be doing something interesting, though;
              perhaps these cyclists ride on the street more often
              than cyclists of other ages.</p>

          <div id="tab-timing-monthly" tab-group="timing" class="tab-content current">
            <img src="{{imagedir}}/monthly.png"/>

            <p>Other than a big jump between 2013 and 2014, the
              apparent trend of increasing collisions in this graph is
              a bit misleading.</p>
          </div>
          <div id="tab-timing-yearly" tab-group="timing" class="tab-content">
            <img src="{{imagedir}}/yearly.png"/>

            <p>Happily, collisions decreased slightly from 2014 to
            2015.

            <p>Any notion that collisions are increasing should be
              adopted cautiously, as there are a number of confounding
              variables. (Hopefully, it represents an increase in the
              number of miles ridden; it almost certainly also
              represents a decrease in handwritten accident reports,
              which can't be automatically parsed and so aren't
              included in these data.)</p>

          <div class="tab-content" tab-group="timing" id="tab-timing-monthly-agg">
            <img src="{{imagedir}}/monthly_aggregate.png"/>

            <p>Predictably, most accidents happen during the summer
              months. February is the safest month, probably because
              even the hardcores have gotten tired of riding in the
              cold and there are so few cyclists out.</p>

            <img src="{{imagedir}}/collision_times.png"/>

            <p>Commutes are the most dangerous times. It's interesting
              that the evening commute -- not the presumably darker
              morning commute -- is more dangerous.</p>

          <h3>Injury Rates and Locations</h3>

          <p>Non-injury collisions are the most likely collisions to
            not be reported, so all of the injury rates below are
            hopefully overestimates.</p>

          <ul class="tabs">
            <li class="tab-link current" tab-group="injuries"
              data-tab="tab-injury-rates">Injuries by collision
              location</li>
            <li class="tab-link" tab-group="injuries"
              data-tab="tab-injury-severities">Injury severities</li>
            <li class="tab-link" tab-group="injuries"
              data-tab="tab-injury-severity-by-age">Injury severity by
              age</li>
            <li class="tab-link" tab-group="injuries"
              data-tab="tab-injury-regions">Injuries by body
              region</li>
          </ul>

          <div id="tab-injury-rates" tab-group="injuries" class="tab-content current">
            <img src="{{imagedir}}/injury_rates.png"/>

            <p>Interestingly, different locations have different
              injury rates.</p>

            <p>Sidewalks have the highest injury rate, but also the
              most non-disabling injuries. Collisions occurring on the
              road are the least likely to lead to injuries, but when
              they do, the injuries are more likely to be
              disabling. Intersections also show more disabling
              injuries. Overall, a collision while riding in the
              street (whether in an intersection or not) is about 2%
              less likely to result in injury, but about 12% more
              likely to result in disabling injury.</p>

            <p>Note that these data are based entirely on accident
              reports, and so do not take into account cyclists who
              are hit and later killed; the "Killed" category only
              represents cyclists who were dead at the scene.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="tab-content" tab-group="injuries" id="tab-injury-severities">
            <img src="{{imagedir}}/injury_severities.png"/>

            <p>Overall, while disabling injuries are scary, they
              represent a fairly small percentage of collisions. That
              said, it's still worrisome that a cyclist is about as
              likely to escape a collision unscathed as to suffer
              disabling injury.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="tab-content" tab-group="injuries" id="tab-injury-severity-by-age">
            <img src="{{imagedir}}/severity_by_age.png"/>

            <p>Injury severity varies only slightly with the age of
              the cyclist.</p>

            <p>This graph uses the LPD injury rating scale, where
              {{1|literal}} is killed and {{5|literal}} is uninjured,
              so lower numbers are more severe injuries. Teenagers and
              early twenty-somethings seem to suffer the most severe
              injuries, but even then the average hovers near "Visible
              but not disabling."  (The other points on the graph that
              dip below that line have too few data points to be
              reliable.)  Unfortunately the age of uninjured cyclists
              is rarely included in the accident report, and never in
              a fashion that's trivial to parse automatically, so this
              graph does not take into account uninjured cyclists.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="tab-content" tab-group="injuries" id="tab-injury-regions">
            <img src="{{imagedir}}/injury_regions.png"/>

            <p>Predictably, injuries are most common to the
              extremities, particularly the lower legs.</p>

          <h2>Map of Collisions</h2>

          <p>All locations should be considered approximations, and
            there are almost certainly mistakes in places.</p>

          <div class="map-container">
            <div class="map-canvas" id="all-collisions-map-canvas"></div>

          <p>Some takeaways:</p>

          <ul class="simple">
            <li>Some intersections may seem more dangerous solely
              because they are more heavily trafficked, not because
              they are actually more dangerous.</li>
            <li>That said, a few corridors seem particularly
              dangerous, with Capital Parkway/Normal Blvd. leading the
              pack. The intersections with 27th, 33rd, and South are
              all among the most dangerous in the city.</li>
            <li>The 27th street and Vine street corridors put in
              strong bids for second-most dangerous, and
              unsurprisingly 27th and Vine is a hotbed of crosswalk
              collisions.</li>
            <li>In general, collisions increase towards downtown and
              diminish as you get further out. There are two notable
              exceptions: The entire length of 84th street (with
              nearly twice as many crosswalk collisions as 70th and
              56th streets); and Pine Lake near 27th. These two areas
              have something in common: Bike paths adjacent to
              streets, where cyclists must still cross many side
              streets. Superior street, which also has a
              street-adjacent bike path, has no nearby analogue to
              compare it to, but it has as many crosswalk collisions
              as Havelock, Fremont, and Holdrege combined.</li>
            <li>A significant number of crosswalk and sidewalk
              collisions occur in the downtown exclusion area. Stop
              riding on the sidewalks downtown already! It's not even
              safer!</li>
            <li>Road collisions, predictably, are focused
              downtown. But at least riding on the streets is
              legal.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>This map may actually contain actionable information; many of the
            most dangerous intersections are at or near bike path underpasses
            or overpasses, so you can avoid crossing 27th at Vine, for
            instance, on the Mopac Trail.</p>

          <h2>LB716 map</h2>

          <p>In early 2016, five state senators
          introduced <a href="http://www.nebike.org/2016/01/breaking-news-lb-716-introduced/">LB716</a>,
          a bill that would (among other things) give cyclists the
          right-of-way in a crosswalk with a signal that is part of a
          bike path. The map below shows where each of the collisions
          that might have been prevented by LB716 took place. The bike
          paths have been highlighted.</p>

          <div class="map-container">
            <div class="map-canvas" id="lb716-map-canvas"></div>
          </div>

          <p>Be careful on Superior and 84th street!</p>

          <p>Although LB716 is pretty narrow, it affects {{ lb716_row
          }} collisions (out of {{ report_count }} total collisions),
          which is {{ "%01.f" % (lb716_row / statuses.crosswalk) * 100
          }}% of all crosswalk collisions.</p>

          <p>More importantly, this represents a whopping {{
          "%0.1f" % (lb716_row / lb716_total) * 100 }}% of all crosswalk
          collisions on bike paths, so, while obviously an incremental
          improvement, LB716 would make our bike paths safer.</p>

          <p>The bike path data is
          from <a href="https://github.com/stpierre/lincoln-bike-routes">a
          related project</a> I undertook as part of this analysis.</p>

          <h2>Qualitative Results</h2>

          <p>A number of interesting trends revealed themselves in
            reading through the reports. Most disturbingly, at least
            some members of LPD have a significant misunderstanding of
            the law, claiming in the
            {{"B3-063805"|report_link("accident")}}
            {{"B4-050934"|report_link("report")}} that
            {{"B4-085278"|report_link("cyclists are required")}} to
            walk their bike across intersections, and
            {{"B4-107448"|report_link("in some cases")}} specifically
            {{"B5-074595"|report_link("noting")}} that they
            "{{"B3-104457"|report_link("lectured")}}" the cyclist.</p>

          <p>In other (fewer) {{"B3-096911"|report_link("cases")}},
            the officer has a {{"B4-063856"|report_link("correct
            understanding")}} of the law, and
            "{{"B5-112375"|report_link("educate")}}" the cyclist; and
            in some cases {{"B3-042103"|report_link("the driver of the
            car was ticketed")}} for
            {{"B2-062920"|report_link("failure to yield")}} to a
            cyclist in a crosswalk.</p>

          <p>The law for crossing private drives is less clear, but
            {{"B2-106960"|report_link("at least one cop")}} thinks
            that bikes on sidewalks must yield to cars in driveways,
            while {{"B5-099464"|report_link("another one
            disagrees")}}.</p>

          <p>Perhaps ironically, in {{"B4-055506"|report_link("one
            case")}} a cyclist who had dismounted to walk his bike
            across the intersection was hit while on foot.</p>

          <p>In some cases, the accident report
            {{"B3-046597"|report_link("mentions")}} that the cyclist
            {{"B4-032910"|report_link("was not wearing a helmet")}},
            despite the fact that this has absolutely no legal
            bearing, nor does it have any bearing on whether or not a
            cyclist is hit. It's hard to see this as anything other
            than editorial victim-blaming. In another case the fact
            that cyclists *were* {{"B5-102671"|report_link("wearing
            helmets and reflective clothing")}} is mentioned; although
            the reflective clothing has a clear bearing on their
            visibility, helmet use again seems to be mentioned simply
            as part of a false correlation with "proper" cycling.</p>

          <p>A {{"B3-049103"|report_link("number")}} of accident
            reports reverse the agents, claiming that
            {{"B4-065578"|report_link("a bike hit a car")}} in cases
            where the car clearly hit the bike. In some cases, it's
            described {{"B4-034454"|report_link("both ways")}}. It's
            not clear why this inversion of causality occurs.</p>

          <p>In some cases, bicyclists
            "{{"B2-019522"|report_link("suddenly appear")}}". Stop
            {{"B3-063032"|report_link("apparating")}} in public or the
            muggles will catch on! (Strangely, the accident reports
            where cyclists {{"B5-081151"|report_link("appear")}} show
            the bike moving through space normally, not
            teleporting.)</p>

          <p>The only place {{"B2-057557"|report_link("two")}}
            "elsewhere" {{"B3-023161"|report_link("collisions")}}
            occurred is on 27th street, just south of Highway 2, where
            there's a cutout of the median to let train tracks cross
            27th street. People are crossing a busy arterial street
            with no crosswalk along train tracks -- with a pedestrian
            bridge overhead. Please don't be dumb.</p>

          <p>Don't {{"B5-114253"|report_link("ride like a dingus")}}.</p>

          <p>{{"B2-072693"|report_link("Please")}},
            {{"B4-049988"|report_link("get information")}} from a
            {{"B2-072693"|report_link("driver")}} who
            {{"B4-090913"|report_link("hits
            you")}}. {{"B2-065976"|report_link("Call the police.")}}
            {{"B3-047233"|report_link("File a report.")}}</p>

            your bike")}}, <b>get some</b>. If you can't afford them,

          <h2>Methodology</h2>

          <p>Accident reports are downloaded automatically from the
            <a href="https://lincoln.ne.gov/city/police/stats/acc.htm"
               class="reference external">Lincoln Police Department's
               website</a>. The reports are parsed automatically and
               selected data are extracted. The data are available
               at <a href="{{all_reports}}" class="reference
               external">{{all_reports}}</a>.

          <p>These reports are then curated by hand to determine where
            the collision happened, as described above. This depends
            on the accuracy of the accident report; anecdotally,
            several cyclists have reported to me that their accident
            reports were not completely accurate. I found one accident
            report where the {{"B3-074762"|report_link("drawing does
            not look like the actual intersection")}} where the
            collision happened, so there are definitely at least some
            inaccuracies. These inaccuracies are not expected to be
            significant, but there's no obvious way to test this with
            the given data set.</p>

          <p>Much of the methodology is described in more detail in the
            <a href="https://github.com/stpierre/crashes/blob/master/README.rst"
               class="reference external">README</a>.  All of the code
               used to generate this report is free and open source
               under the
            <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.en.html"
               class="reference external">GPLv2</a>.</p>

          <p>I have made no effort at all to determine fault, as that
            process would be fraught beyond any semblance of
            reason.</p>

          <p>The Lincoln Police Department deserves special thanks for
            their open records. In the other two largest cities in
            Nebraska, the Omaha and Grand Island Police Departments
            both charge for accident reports ($5 and $6,
            respectively), and the Omaha Police Department does not
            allow listing accident reports. Lincoln's open records
            made this project possible.</p>

          <h2>Further Study</h2>

          <p>There are lots of hit-and-runs, mostly by cars but in
            some cases by cyclists, too. (The cyclists who run from a
            collision seem to generally be kids.) It'd be nice to
            gather data on that.</p>

          <p>Charting the time of day of collisions throughout the
            calendar year might demonstrate how darkness affects (or
            doesn't affect) collisions.</p>
